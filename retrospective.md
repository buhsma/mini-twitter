# Retrospective: Mini Twitter Project

## Introduction

This retrospective reflects on the development process of the Mini Twitter project, focusing on challenges encountered, lessons learned, and areas for improvement.

### Project Overview

The Mini Twitter project aimed to develop a simple Twitter-like application using Laravel for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL as the database. Despite initial difficulties due to the new technologies involved, the project progressed with the help of available resources, including guidance from GPT.

## Challenges

### Learning Curve

- **Laravel and Vue.js:** Both Laravel and Vue.js were new technologies for me, which presented a steep learning curve at the beginning of the project.
- **Getting Started:** Understanding the basics of Laravel's MVC architecture and Vue.js components took some time initially.

### Deployment

- **Domain and SSL Setup:** Setting up a domain and configuring SSL for secure communication posed challenges, especially navigating through domain registrars and server configurations.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Integrating a seamless deployment pipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) was initially complex.

### Authentication

- **JWT Implementation:** Understanding and implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication required significant research and experimentation.

## Lessons Learned

### Rapid Learning

- **Adaptability:** Despite the initial challenges, I quickly adapted to the new technologies, thanks to resources like documentation, tutorials, and assistance from GPT.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Hands-on practice played a crucial role in understanding Laravel's and Vue.js' concepts effectively.

### Deployment Strategies

- **Exploration:** Exploring various deployment strategies, including manual setup and automated deployment tools, provided valuable insights into deployment processes.
- **Documentation Reading:** Reading through documentation thoroughly helped in grasping deployment concepts and procedures effectively.

### Authentication Best Practices

- **Security Awareness:** Learning about JWT authentication heightened awareness regarding security best practices in web application development.
- **Implementation Experience:** Implementing JWT authentication provided practical experience in securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.

## Areas for Improvement

### Documentation Utilization

- **Early Reference:** Utilizing documentation more effectively from the project's inception could have expedited the learning process and reduced initial hurdles.

### Deployment Planning

- **Preparation:** Preparing a deployment plan early in the project lifecycle could streamline the deployment process and mitigate configuration challenges.
- **Test Environments:** Setting up test environments for deployment experimentation and validation could help in refining deployment strategies before production rollout.

### Authentication Exploration

- **Early Research:** Conducting in-depth research on authentication methods and practices, including JWT, before implementation could have reduced the learning curve during development.

## Conclusion

The Mini Twitter project provided valuable learning experiences in Laravel, Vue.js, deployment procedures, and authentication mechanisms. Despite encountering challenges, the project's progression was facilitated by rapid learning, adaptation, and utilization of available resources. Moving forward, incorporating lessons learned from this project will enhance proficiency in web development and deployment practices.

**Special Thanks:** I would like to express my gratitude to Melke and Beni for their support and guidance throughout the project.
